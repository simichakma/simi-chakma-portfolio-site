# Welcome to my portfolio project

## Simi Chakma – AI-Generated Portfolio

This portfolio was generated using Lovable.dev, an AI-powered tool that creates visually appealing and responsive personal websites automatically. Instead of building the site manually from scratch, I experimented with Lovable to demonstrate a creative and efficient approach to portfolio development using modern AI tools.

 ## What’s Included
Responsive Design powered by Lovable's modern layout engine

Clean, Professional UI with built-in sections like About Me, Projects, Skills, and Contact

Minimal Code Overhead – auto-generated HTML/CSS/JS for fast deployment

Deployed on GitHub Pages for free and seamless hosting

Custom Edits – I made slight adjustments post-generation for personal branding

 ## Purpose
This project reflects how AI tools can accelerate and simplify professional portfolio creation, especially for developers and students who want a strong online presence but have limited design experience. It also showcases my interest in leveraging innovative tools and technologies in creative ways.
